    "reasoning": "The data structure is designed to store financial transactions for users. To ensure security and scalability, the structure is optimized for path-based ownership, which simplifies security rules and enhances data privacy. Each user has a dedicated collection of transactions, ensuring that only the user can access their own data. This approach leverages Firestore's hierarchical data model effectively.\n\n*   **Authorization Independence:** The chosen structure `/artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId}/transactions/{transactionId}` inherently enforces authorization independence. Access to the `transactions` subcollection is solely determined by the `userId` derived from `request.auth.uid`. There is no need to fetch parent document data to authorize access to transactions.\n*   **QAPs Support:** List operations are secured because the path-based ownership ensures that listing transactions under `/artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId}/transactions` will only return transactions belonging to the authenticated user (`userId` matches `request.auth.uid`).\n*   **Denormalization:** There is no denormalization required. The transactions are user-owned; therefore authorization is achieved through path-based rules."
