/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user can only access their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is nested under `/artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId}`, where `userId` matches the authenticated user's UID.
 * User documents are stored at `/artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId}` and transaction documents are stored under `/artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId}/transactions/{transactionId}`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own user documents.
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own transaction documents.
 * - Listing other user documents or transactions is not allowed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - None required. Authorization is achieved through path-based rules.
