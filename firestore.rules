/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for the Finanças app.
 *
 * @corePhilosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, ensuring that users can only
 *                 access and manipulate data associated with their own accounts.
 *
 * @dataStructure The database is structured with user profiles stored in `/users/{userId}` and
 *                individual transaction records stored in the `/users/{userId}/transactions/{transactionId}`
 *                subcollection. This design enforces clear ownership and simplifies access control.
 *
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 *   - Users can only read and write their own user profile data.
 *   - Users can only create, read, update, and delete transactions associated with their own user ID.
 *   - Listing all users is disallowed to protect user privacy.
 *   - Data validation is relaxed to allow for rapid prototyping, focusing on ownership and
 *     relational integrity checks rather than exhaustive schema validation.
 *
 * @denormalizationForAuthorization Not applicable in this configuration.
 *
 * @structuralSegregation User profiles and transactions are stored in a hierarchical structure,
 *                       segregating data based on user ownership. This approach is more secure and
 *                       performant than using a single collection with a user ID field.
