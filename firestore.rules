/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model.  Users can only
 * access data under their own user ID. This ensures data privacy and
 * prevents unauthorized access.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The data is organized hierarchically under `/artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId}`,
 * with user data and transactions stored as subcollections. The `appId` allows for
 * isolating data across different application instances, providing an extra layer
 * of security and organization.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is implicitly disallowed; there are no rules granting `list`
 *   permission on the `/users` collection.
 * - The default security posture is strict: any access not explicitly allowed
 *   is denied.
 * - Data validation is minimized in this prototyping phase to allow for rapid
 *   schema iteration. Only critical authorization fields are validated.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * No denormalization is required as the path-based ownership model naturally
 * aligns with Firestore's security rules.  Authorization checks can be
 * performed directly on the path without needing to read additional data.
