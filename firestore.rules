/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for financial transactions. Each user has a dedicated collection of transactions, ensuring that only the user can access their own data.
 * @dataStructure
 *   /artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId} - Stores user profile information.
 *   /artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId}/transactions/{transactionId} - Stores financial transactions for a specific user.
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 *   - User listing is implicitly disallowed because there is no rule allowing it.
 *   - All write operations are strictly owner-only.
 *   - Read operations are also restricted to the owner of the user id in question.
 *   - No data shape validation is performed beyond authorization and relational integrity checks.
 * @denormalization
 *   - Not required. Authorization is achieved through path-based rules.
