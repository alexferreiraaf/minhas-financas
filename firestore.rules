/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model.  Each user can only access their own user document and the transactions nested under their user document.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information. The {userId} MUST match the authenticated user's UID.
 * - /users/{userId}/transactions/{transactionId}: Stores transaction records for a specific user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create their own user document.
 * - Transactions are private to the user and stored as a subcollection of the user's document.
 * - Listing all users is disallowed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - The `Transaction` entity already has a `userId` field, which is good.  The create operation will enforce that the `userId` in the document matches the `userId` in the path.
