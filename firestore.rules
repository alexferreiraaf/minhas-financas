/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user can only access their own data,
 * specifically their user document and their transactions.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * Data is nested under /artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId}/transactions/{transactionId}.
 * The /artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId} document stores user-specific data.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Data validation is minimal, focusing on authorization and relational integrity.
 * - The rules leverage path-based authorization for efficiency and security.
