/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for financial transactions.
 *   Each user has a dedicated data tree under /artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId}/..., and only the
 *   authenticated user matching the {userId} can read and write their own data.
 * @data_structure
 *   - /artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.
 *   - /artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId}/transactions/{transactionId}: Stores financial transactions for a specific user.
 * @key_security_decisions
 *   - User listing is implicitly denied as there are no rules allowing it.
 *   - Only authenticated users can access their own data; anonymous access is not permitted beyond potential public read collections (if defined).
 *   - The rules are designed to be authorization independent; no data from parent documents needs to be fetched for child document authorization.
