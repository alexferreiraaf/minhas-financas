/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model.  Users can only read and write their own data. Data validation is relaxed for rapid prototyping.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.
 * - /users/{userId}/transactions/{transactionId}: Stores financial transactions for a specific user as a subcollection.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own transactions data.
 * - Data validation is minimized to allow for flexible data shapes during prototyping.
 * - Listing all users is not permitted.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The 'Transaction' entity requires a `userId` field, which is used to match transactions to users, to prevent costly `get()` operations.
