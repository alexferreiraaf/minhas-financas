/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model.  Users can only
 * access their own data.  Authorization is based on the `userId` found in
 * the document path.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The data is organized hierarchically under /artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId}/transactions/{transactionId}.
 * Each transaction is owned by a specific user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Listing all transactions across all users is disallowed. Only listing transactions
 *   for a specific user is permitted.
 * - Data shape validation is relaxed to facilitate rapid prototyping.  Only
 *   authorization-critical fields (e.g., `userId`) are validated.
 * - The `appId` parameter in the path is not validated in these rules, assuming it's managed
 *   and consistent within the application's deployment and not directly exposed to user input.
