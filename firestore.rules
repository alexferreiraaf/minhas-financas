     * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for both user profiles and their financial transactions.
     * All data is nested under `/artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId}`, ensuring that only the authenticated user can access their own data.
     * Data relating to a specific user should stored under a path containing that user's id.
     *
     * Key Security Decisions:
     * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own user document and transactions.
     * - Listing transactions is restricted to the owner of the transactions.
     *
     * Structural Segregation:
     * - Private user data (transactions) are stored in a user-specific subcollection, enforcing access control through path-based rules.
     *
     * Denormalization for Authorization:
     * - Not Required: Authorization is achieved through path-based rules.
